# Gitpod Editors

Gitpod has two editors: Theia and VS Code. VS Code is the newly added editor and also the new default, while the majority of the chapters and recordings depict the Theia editor.

#### Note about VS Code menu UI

The menu layout in VS Code can be changed. It appears that sometimes the default menu is collapsed as a "hamburger-style_ menu, but other times it is fully visible. You can toggle this effect.

# Intro to HTML

<!-- Find early history of web stuff and talk about hypertext, URLs, whatever. Now, let's start building. -->

 - hyper_text_
 - normal flow
 - text goes left-to-right (most of the time)
 - inline diagram — words
 - whitespace insignificant — any whitespace separates words
 - 



## Some text on the page

Raghu Betina

I write software, books, and bad jokes at firstdraft.

I teach at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

I host open mic nights on my rooftop.

Needs structure. We give it that with _tags_. (Whitespace insignificant.) We'll tag each _block_ of content using `<div>` (the "content division" element). What's a block?

(Drawing of book and paragraphs with dropcaps and inline images.)

<div>Raghu Betina</div>

<div>I make software, videos, writings, and bad jokes at firstdraft.</div>

<div>I teach at The University of Chicago Booth School of Business.</div>

<div>I host open mic nights on my rooftop.</div>




Everything is a box.

html is a box that fills the browser, which fills the screen
all the elements are boxes that fill that box
humans like rectangles

How can we tell the browser how we would like the boxes to be arranged?

HTML has multiple layout modes.

Flow layout — for text
